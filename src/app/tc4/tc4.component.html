  <p class="text-justify">
    Proper integration of the emerging secure and safe autonomy algorithms into practical 
    flight software is challenging. Moreover, experimenting the developed algorithms in different 
    environments (dynamic simulation system, small-scale Indoor Flight Facility (IFF), and large-scale Outdoor Flight Facility (OFF)) and
     performing different missions (with dependency analytics, integrated simulation (SIM), 
    and experimental flight tests through fast learning cycles) is required to guarantee the correctness of the UAM network.

      <p class="text-justify">
        TC4 will create methods to integrate secure and safe autonomy algorithms 
        and software (developed in TC1 and TC2, and validated in TC3) into UAM platforms
         and networks via experimentation in a dynamic virtual simulation environment (SIM) 
         and two physical environments (a small-scale Indoor Flight Facility (IFF), and a large-scale Outdoor Flight Field (OFF)).
          These environments represent an ecosystem to examine integrated elements of a UAM network together in the context of various
           long-term missions involving many vehicles in a complex environment. A set of performance metrics will be established to provide
            a means to assess maturity of different algorithm configurations and to compare them with the baseline autonomy algorithms.
             Team members from TC1, TC2, and TC3 will engage with these environments, both in the early stages and during the program, to 
             enable rapid learning and evolution of safe and secure algorithms for the UTM application. TC4 activities will provide continuous
              feedback to TC1-TC3 innovators on the merits
         of their concepts and the best opportunities for transitions to practice with industry partners to realize mobility and economic benefits

              The system integration strategy, algorithms for 
              perception, autonomous control, navigation, V&V, and 
              experimental testbeds will all be especially enhanced by funded 
              partners Aurora Flight Sciences and Alakaâ€™i Technologies. These partnerships 
              will provide testing platforms that support the regulatory and policy transitions of safe and 
              secure assured autonomy applications to the industry. The transition requires evidence from flight experiments to 
              justify transition. Our research team will work closely with the Subject Matter Experts (SME) from our four industry partners and NASA to seek both 
              commercialization and regulatory advisory consultation. Northrop Grumman Corporation will advise the team regarding experimentation 
              and learning in virtual and physical environments. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems  will provide support by presenting real-world use cases for 
              evaluating integrated assured autonomy .
