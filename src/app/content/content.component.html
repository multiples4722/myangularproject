        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="text-justify">An unmanned aviation systems future will see the integration of a wide variety of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), personal
         air vehicles, and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems including Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles, cargo and special mission aircraft into the
          National Airspace System (NAS). These developments leverage technologies in autonomy, UAS Traffic Management (UTM), electric powertrain
           reliability, multi-redundant flight systems architectures, and advancing wireless connectivity, to enable unique requirements of AAM
            airspace and aircraft management. Funded by NASA’s Aeronautics University Leadership Initiative (ULI), our
         team is advancing the industrial deployment of secure and safe assured autonomy to meet the following needs:  
       <ul>
         <li>Manage air traffic in dynamic and uncertain airspace operations </li>
         <li>Operate securely and safely in varying levels of system complexity</li>
       </ul>

        <p class="text-justify">
          Our ULI team brings together a diverse interdisciplinary team of experts from three universities−North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
           University (N.C. A&T), Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech.) and Purdue University (Purdue)−along with four United States industry
            partners−Aurora Flight Sciences (Aurora), Skai (an Alaka’i Technologies company(Skai)), General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI), and
             Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC). This ambitious initiative actively explores transition opportunities of the research and products to
              industry and government. NC A&T and Purdue researchers are experts in systems and controls, cyber security, real-time Verification and
               Validation (V&V) and system of systems applications in UAS and UAM. Georgia Tech. researchers have expertise in aerospace and aeronautical
                engineering, particularly in system development, software testing, controls, autonomy and formal verification methods, aerial vehicle design
                 and modeling, and use-case development. The collaboration with industry will include both advisory consultation and direct participation in the
                  system integration component of the proposed research. Aurora will provide access to its multi-vehicle test environment, which will support the
                   ULI team’s integration efforts. They will also incorporate the developed algorithms into multi-vehicle experimentation and simulations with humans
                    in the loop. Skai will contribute to Urban and Regional Air Mobility (URAM) vehicle control laws for testing in simulation and flight, Simplified
                     Vehicle Operations (SVO), vehicle broadband connectivity solutions, as well as flight licensing and certification and other activities to create
                      industry consensus around these
           emerging technologies. GA-ASI and NGC will advise the team regarding
            experimentation and learning in virtual and physical environments.
